# Opening Existing Program

# Notes

#### A Warning About Tool & User Frames

Each action is created with an associated User Frame (UF) and User Tool (UT). These specify the frames used to plan robot motion and give context to the robot position and orientation goal specified by the currently selected action. This means they are not the same as the UF and UT set for the robot controller and if they do not match when the action is executed, an error will be thrown halting program execution.

If you experience this problem, open `Robot Operation -> Jog` and set the UT and UF fields to match those of the actions in your program.

Note that your program can also select the UF for the program to use through an action in the block language.
