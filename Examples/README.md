# ROS2 Examples
This directory contains example ROS2 code for the iRobot Create3. 

Expect each directory here to be a ROS2 workspace which will need to be built before the example code can be run.

## Example Setup
1. `cd` into example directory.
2. Run `colcon build`.
3. Start new terminal session.
4. `cd` into example directory and source setup with `source install/setup.sh`.
5. `cd` into `<example-directory>/src/<example-package>/<example_package>`.
6. Run code with `python3 main.py`
